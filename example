room{
	rooms[]
	text
	entities[][]
}
how do you make it so you can define a function dynamically?
	maybe you can just set a certain number of functions and keep an array or linked list or string that contains a code that will acivate different functions with each array/character
	just check the 0th item of each item in each item in the 'code' array, this can even have a little bit of compiling if necessary

func1 item{
	delete entity item
	edit player stat OP X
}

// make passive checks?
passive1 item{
	if item exists/has attr/{
		func1 item
	}
}

you can parse the text to seperate items out into individual items, maybe objects with arrays
	entities become objects
	functions become arrays, so that instructions can still bei in order
	should entities contain functions?  Point to a function id?
